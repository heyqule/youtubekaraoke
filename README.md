Orignal MVs usually work the best, kind of... except snares sound funny / missing

<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSM3w1v-A_Y (Timbaland - Apologize ft. OneRepublic)

Too many details lost with rock/metal or beats heavy songs

Snare sounds funny in raps... in fact, many parts sound funny lol.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY (Childish Gambino - This Is America)

It's not able to cut certain part of the vocal due to the way it mixed.

<br /> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5anLPw0Efmo (Evanescence - My Immortal)

The result from concerts MVs are usually not as good.
